# monkey_brain_goes_woop_woop
This is supposed to be a arduino MCU + sensor learning project, but sometimes monkey brain just goes... Woop woop.

## Current setup
Arduino Uno with Arduino ISP hooked via ICSP to bricked Leonardo

## Roadmap
Modify Leonardo to function as an ISP flasher
  [] Get Leonardo USB working
  [] Write a bootloader to Leonardo
  [] Begin flashing Leonardo over USB using bootloader and SPM? Ditch Uno and Arduino ISP at this point, wohoo. Also no need for the ICSP connection anymore between Uno And Leonardo
  [] To be continued...
